## 2. stretch-goals

In our lab there was some stretch-goals.

- Handle the display and voting for an arbitrary number of images
- Using a variable, declare in your JS how many images to show.
- Based on that value, dynamically create that many `<img>` tags
- Also based on that value, ensure that your randomizer is properly handling the specified number of images for display and repeat tracking.

You will find the solution of these requirment in this branch.
